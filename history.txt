# Uptime Kuma Deployment History

## 2024-02-10 - Initial Troubleshooting

### Issues Found:
1. Environment variables not being passed correctly to container
2. Database connectivity failing
3. ALB health checks failing
4. Container unable to start properly

### Changes Made:
1. Updated task definition:
   - Changed from entryPoint to command
   - Added workingDirectory
   - Added POSTGRES_* environment variables

2. Updated Dockerfile:
   - Fixed file permissions
   - Changed working directory
   - Removed ENTRYPOINT

3. Updated init script:
   - Added environment variable validation
   - Added export of DB_* variables
   - Added proper error handling

4. Updated ECS service:
   - Moved to private subnets
   - Removed public IP assignment

### Current Status:
- ALB health checks still failing
- Database connectivity still failing
- Container logs show environment variables not being interpolated

### Next Steps:
1. Verify security group rules between ALB, ECS, and RDS
2. Check container startup sequence
3. Validate environment variable handling
4. Review ALB health check configuration

### Lessons Learned:
1. Environment variables need both DB_* and POSTGRES_* prefixes
2. Container needs proper working directory setup
3. Private subnets require proper NAT gateway setup
4. Security groups need careful review
